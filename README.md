Hi! I’m Gi-Morello,
I’m interested in becoming a full time software developer, I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Information Systems.
I’m currently working on improving my current skills I've learned from university while also taking time to do some projects with tools I've yet to learn.

Currently I'm looking into learning more about Springboot as Java is my primary language of choice. I also want to do a project with React. 

Technical Skills and Computer Science Coursework:
* Software Engineering: GitHub, GitLab, Java, JavaScript, and C# based projects, Unity, Comfortable working in Agile environments
* Programming: Java, C#, JavaScript, C
* Web Development: HTML & CSS, Angular Framework
* Database Management: ERD Plus, SQL, Oracle
* Operating Systems: Windows, MacOS, Linux, Bash Scripting, Virtual Machines, Ubuntu, Kali, Wireshark

For Fun:
I like to do game dev as a hobby, and play a lot of video games in my spare time! I'm also currently studying Japanese, I took courses at my university 
but now I'm self studying to maintain my skills. I hope to visit Japan again someday, and involve international travel in my future career!
